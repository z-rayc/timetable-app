User will then see an empty timetable and will have to select their courses. They can use the course's name or ID (course code) to search for it and search in a predefined list. Then save the changes.

Now the classes will show up in the timetable and they have access to the course's chatroom.

Users can click on the cards in the timetable to view details about that class or event.
